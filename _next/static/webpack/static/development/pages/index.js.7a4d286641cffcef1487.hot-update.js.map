Depending on the application you want to build\n              you can install different modules. The major module is the\n              \"Rokkit.ts core\". The core helps you starting and preconfiguring\n              other modules. Moreover this module is capable of the framework's\n              dependency injection.\n              <br />\n              Currentlty there is only one further module the web module. Its\n              purpose is to build restful APIs or to query other services. It\n              comes with a buildin web-server (restify) and provides you the\n              ability to easily create controllers. We will discover this\n              functionallity a bit later. <br />\n              To use Rokkit.ts make sure you have typescript installed and that\n              you created a simple \"tsconfig.json\" Now you can just run the\n              install commands on the right.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img className=\"code-img\" src=\"../../static/images/install.svg\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description-container\">\n          <div className=\"description\">\n            <h4 className=\"highlight-text\">Use the Rokkit.ts CLI</h4>\n            <p>\n              Beside creating your project from scratch you can also use the\n              Rokkit.ts CLI. The cli currently supports three commands.\n              <ul>\n                <li>Init -- initialize a new project</li>\n                <li>Build -- build the application</li>\n                <li>Run -- run the application</li>\n              </ul>\n              The cli comes with our core package and can easily be used. We\n              recommend it to create your first project. Just use the same\n              command as provided on the right side.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img className=\"code-img\" src=\"../../static/images/cli.svg\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </>\n    ) : null;\n\n  const createApp =\n    state && state === create ? (\n      <>\n        <div className=\"description-container\">\n          <div className=\"description\">\n            <h4 className=\"highlight-text\">Base class</h4>\n            <p>\n              Now that you have installed the needed modules of Rokkit.ts let's\n              starting developing. We will build a simple REST API that returns\n              hello world.\n              <br />\n              We will start with our base class. Rokkit.ts needs an entry point\n              to your project. As you can see on the right. The base class is\n              quite empty and just annotated with the \"RokkitRunner\" decorator.\n              This decorator tells Rokkit.ts to run the start procedure. You\n              have to provide the root path of your source directory to the\n              decorator. We need this path to find your further classes. You\n              don't even need a constructor in this class, we are planning to\n              provide more functionality for the base class in the future. For\n              now it is just an entry point to the project.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img\n              className=\"code-img\"\n              src=\"../../static/images/init-class.svg\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description-container\">\n          <div className=\"description\">\n            <h4 className=\"highlight-text\">Building a controller</h4>\n            <p>\n              So we created our base class let's create a controller to send our\n              hello world message. On the right you can see a new class for our\n              controller. It is marked with the controller decorator. the\n              controller decorator expects an uri base path. We use \"/sample\"\n              here. This means that our controller will be available on the\n              following URI: \"http://host:port/sample\".\n              <br />\n              Within our controller we now want to add some functionality.\n              Therefore we can add a method that will respond to a request on a\n              mapped path. In our code on the right we have the method\n              \"greetWorld\". Because of its decorator it will respond to every\n              GET request against our resource. You can also fill a request path\n              into the decorator to specify the whole path. The result of the\n              method will be used as the result of the request.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img\n              className=\"code-img\"\n              src=\"../../static/images/simple-controller.svg\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description-container\">\n          <div className=\"description\">\n            <h4 className=\"highlight-text\">Using dependency injection</h4>\n            <p>\n              We managed to create a basic controller, but how about extending\n              this one by using the Rokkit.ts dependency injection. As you can\n              see we added a constructor to our class. With two arguments. The\n              first argument is a \"GreetingGenerator\". It's just another user\n              class which hold some kind of logic. The second argument is a\n              basic string. In order to use the dependency injection for native\n              objects like strings, numbers, booleans, you have to use the\n              annotation \"Inject\" and provide the value that will be injected.\n              In our case \"Hello\" will be injected we the class is created. You\n              can also use this decorator for user classes but there is a easier\n              way. Because the \"GreetingGenerator\" is a registered class of the\n              project. Rokkit.ts is able to automatically inject an instance. So\n              you just have to declare it a the constructor. There is only one\n              thing you need to do, you need to annotate the user comoponent\n              that will be inejcted with one of the following decorators\n              \"Component\", \"Controller\", \"Service\". This tells Rokkit.ts that\n              this class is important for the dependency injection. Classes\n              without that decorators won't be recognized.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img\n              className=\"code-img\"\n              src=\"../../static/images/controller.svg\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </>\n    ) : null;\n  const deployApp =\n    state && state === deploy ? (\n      <>\n        <div className=\"description-container\">\n          <div className=\"description\">\n            <h4 className=\"highlight-text\">\n              Running an app in development mode\n            </h4>\n            <p>\n              After completing your first controller let's start your\n              application and test it. In order to run Rokkit.ts in development\n              mode you need to install ts-node. After installing it, just use it\n              to run your entry point class.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img className=\"code-img\" src=\"../../static/images/dev.svg\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description-container\">\n          <div className=\"description\">\n            <h4 className=\"highlight-text\">\n              Running an app in production mode\n            </h4>\n            <p>\n              When you finished your development and want to run the application\n              in production mode, you need to build it. There are two steps to\n              build the application currentlty: 1. Run the application with\n              ts-node. This will generate an directory with an declaration file.\n              This file is needed for Rokkit.ts in production. This file\n              provides important information for the dependency injection and\n              speeds up the whole starting process. In development mode the file\n              will be recreate every time. After running the app in development\n              mode use the TypeScript compiler to build the project. At this\n              time you need to use \"build\" as the outDir in the \"tsconfig.json\".\n              After build your application just run the entrypoint class with\n              Node.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img className=\"code-img\" src=\"../../static/images/prod.svg\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </>\n    ) : null;\n\n  const setActive = action => {\n    setState(action);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        className={state === install ? \"active-button\" : \"\"}\n        onClick={() => setActive(install)}\n      >\n        Install Rokkit.ts\n      </button>\n      {installRokkit}\n      <button\n        className={state === create ? \"active-button\" : \"\"}\n        onClick={() => setActive(create)}\n      >\n        Creating your first app\n      </button>\n      {createApp}\n      <button\n        className={state === deploy ? \"active-button\" : \"\"}\n        onClick={() => setActive(deploy)}\n      >\n        Deploying the application\n      </button>\n      {deployApp}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default GetStarted;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAJA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAKA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAYA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAqBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAeA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAKA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
